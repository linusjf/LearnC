## Synopsis

This project contains code examples from Oswald Campesato's C Programming Pocket Primer. Almost all programs  can be compiled and run individually using either the shell script `buildrun` or the make files `programs.make` and `test.make`.

## Code Example


## Motivation

My motivation was to refresh my C programming skills and to learn and apply the intricacies of make files while running the example code.

## Installation
Use `git clone` to download the code to your machine.

## API Reference

The codebase does not rely on any libraries other than the standard C library  except for `libm.a` which can be linked using the `-lm` switch of the `gcc` compiler.

## Tests

No unit tests.

## Contributors

Obviously the author and myself for any code enhancements.
